# CSW1-Project
This repo contains the final project of the subject CSW-1.
Here I am going to walk you through the working of the program, right from the point of execution and explain all the different windows that open gradually.

Firstly, upon execution of the codes the following window opens.

 

This is the front page of our project. Here the title of our project is displayed and also the logo of the college. And then below the logo there is a button with the label “CLICK HERE TO CONTINUE”. When this button is clicked the login window opens.

 
Here the username (admin) and password (admin) is entered. Then upon clicking the “Login” button the Student Details tab opens with the buttons that allow you to perform the various operations. If incorrect username or password is entered, then a message pops up saying “Invalid Login Credentials”.

 

Then upon successful login the Student Detail page opens.

 

Here there are four buttons that perform various functions. 
•	The “Add” button opens a form that allows you to enter details of a new student that is to be stored in the database.
•	The “View” button allows you to view the details of a student fetched from the database
•	The “Remove” button enables you to delete the details of a student from the database.
•	The “Update” button allows you to change the details of an already existing student in the database.

Now we will see the functioning of each button in details, a thorough walk-through of how to add, view, remove and update a student details in the database.

Adding a student to the database
To add a new student to the database, hit the “Add” button. When we click the “Add” button it opens an Add Student tab. In this tab there is a form that asks you to enter the required details of the student you want to store in the database.

 

Upon hitting the “Submit” button a message pops up reading “Details successfully inserted”.

 

If you hit the “Cancel” button then it redirects you to the Student Detail page.

Viewing a student’s details
To view a particular student’s details click the “View” button. When this button is clicked a tab opens that enables us to search for the particular student whose details you want to view by entering his/her Student ID.

 

Upon entering the Student ID and hitting the “Search” button it opens a new tab that displays the details of the student whose id we just searched.

 

Then when we hit the “Print” button it displays a message reading “Printed Successfully.” And if we hi the “Cancel” button it redirects to the “View” window.
 

Updating a student’s details

To update a student’s details we hit the “Update” button. Upon clicking this button a “Search” tab opens which requires a student’s ID to search for the particular student whose details you want to update.

 

Then we hit the “Search” button and we get the same form that we get when adding a student. But in this case we get the form with all the previously entered data that we had entered while adding that particular student.

 

Then we can update the details of the student through the form. In this case we have updated the package of the student from 4.5 to 5.5. Then after updating the required information we hit the “Update” button and a confirmation message pops up and we are redirected to the Details page again.

 

Removing a student from the database

To remove or delete a student’s details from the database we use the “Remove” button. When we click this button a new tab opens that again asks for the ID of the student whose details you want to delete.

 

Then after entering the student’s ID we hit the Search button. Then the essential details of the student is displayed whom we want to remove.

 

Then to remove that student we hit the “Remove” button. This deletes the details of the student from the database and a confirmation message pops up and upon hitting the OK button we redirected to the Details window.

 

And to confirm if the student’s details have actually been removed, if we search that particular ID from the Remove window then a message pops up reading “ID not found”.

 

Upon hitting the OK button it redirects us to the Details window.
